Revision 1
==============================================================================
Known bugs:
 - missing 10k pullup resistors on SDA and SCL (5V Slave-side)
 - C4 has to be 22pF instead of 33pF (like stated in MCP23016 datasheet)
 - connectors place behind screws
 - raspberry screws or connector not exactly over J26
