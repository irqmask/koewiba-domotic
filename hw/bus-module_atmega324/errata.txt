Revision A:
-------------------
- The revision is not printed on a copper layer. At least one but better the top and bottom shall have revision number, which is still readable when all connectors are in place.
- Footprint for TVS-Diode (D2) is too big.
- Fuse in 24V branch is missing.
- BTX and BTXEN inputs are floating. Shall have pull-down resistors ~10k to assure proper level. The missing pull-down resistor leads to bus-message errors.

Revision B:
-------------------
- R2...4 shall be 100Ohms instead of 1k
- WAGO243 pin-holes are too tight
- Use 100ÂµF multilayer ceramic capacitor instead of electrolytic capacitor
- need pull-down resistor ~10k for TXEN signal if it is not constantly driven by outer circuit
